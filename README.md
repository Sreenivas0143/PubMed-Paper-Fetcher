# üìÑ PubMed-Paper-Fetcher

**CLI tool to fetch PubMed papers with authors affiliated to pharma/biotech companies.**

**PubMed Paper Fetcher** is a Python-based command-line tool that allows users to search for research papers from **PubMed** using any query. It intelligently identifies papers with at least one author affiliated with **pharmaceutical or biotech companies**, using heuristics like keywords in affiliations or email domains.

It extracts and outputs the following details:

- **PubMed ID**
- **Title**
- **Publication Date**
- **Non-academic Author(s)**
- **Company Affiliation(s)**
- **Corresponding Author Email**

The tool supports full PubMed query syntax, outputs results as a **CSV file** or to the **console**, and is designed with clean architecture using **typed Python**, **Poetry**, and **Click** for a smooth CLI experience.

This project is ideal for **HR recruiters**, **researchers**, and **data analysts** seeking structured insights into industry-linked biomedical publications.
